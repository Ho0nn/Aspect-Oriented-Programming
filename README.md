##  What is AOP?
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a way to separate cross-cutting concerns like logging, exception handling, and security from the core logic. Instead of repeating the same code in many places, AOP makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

##  Project Overview  
In big projects, things like logging, security, and error handling are used in multiple parts of the code. Instead of adding the same code everywhere, we use AOP with Spring Boot to manage these concerns in a separate, organized way. This project shows how AOP helps reduce code repetition and keeps the core logic simple and clear.


##  Features
AOP with Spring Framework:
Using Spring AOP to handle things like logging and performance tracking.

Cross-Cutting Concern Separation:
Keeps logging and exception handling isolated from business logic to improve maintainability.

Spring Boot Integration:
AOP works dynamically at the service layer to intercept method calls without changing the core code.

Implements logging, performance tracking, and error handling aspects that showcase practical usage.
