# Aspect-Oriented-Programming

# What is (AOP)?
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that modularizes cross-cutting concerns such as logging, exception handling, and security.
By separating these concerns from the core business logic, AOP promotes cleaner, more maintainable code.

## üéØ Project Overview  
In large applications, many functionalities like logging, security, and error handling cut across multiple layers of the codebase. Instead of duplicating these functionalities throughout the code, **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** provides a cleaner and modular way to handle them. This project demonstrates how to leverage AOP concepts using **Spring Boot** to reduce code redundancy and separate concerns effectively.

## üöÄ Features
AOP with Spring Framework:
Leverages Spring AOP to manage aspects like logging and performance tracking efficiently.

Cross-Cutting Concern Separation:
Keeps logging and exception handling isolated from business logic to improve maintainability.

Spring Boot Integration:
Combines AOP with Spring Boot to intercept calls at the service layer dynamically.

Real-World Usage Examples:
Implements logging, performance tracking, and error handling aspects that showcase practical usage.

## üõ† Implemented Aspects

1Ô∏è‚É£ Logging Aspect

Logs every service call and captures essential details.

Tracks execution time for monitoring performance.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exception Handling Aspect

Catches exceptions across services and logs them for troubleshooting.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Tracking Aspect

Monitors service execution time and triggers alerts if delays occur.
